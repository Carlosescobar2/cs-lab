Not very suprised to find that the tinyArray, smallArray, and mediumArray were the fatest to run. 
The reason why is because the smaller the number the easier it is to double and 
this is why the extraLargeArray takes the longest. Another thing to add why the function is a little slower is 
 because it loops through the nums.length which takes longer than just looping through a certain 
 number instead.
